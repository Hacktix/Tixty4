## What's this?

Tixty4 is an attempt at a Nintendo 64 Emulator using plain C. However, as this is my first time writing an N64 emulator, as well as my first time using C for a major project, don't expect this to be revolutionary.

## Features and Goals

**Things that currently work:**

- Compiling the Emulator (sometimes)
- Starting the Emulator
- Framebuffer Rendering using SDL2
- A very rudimentary "debugger" on the command line
- A few basic test ROMs for the most basic of basic CPU instructions

**Things that should eventually work:**

- Input via Keyboard & Controller
- Actual Graphics & Sound
- *Running Games*
